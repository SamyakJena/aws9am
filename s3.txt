S3 : Simple Storage Service : 

--> Object based storage : Designed to store flat files.. We cann't install OS.. : s3
--> Block based storage : Designed to run OS.. : EBS, Instance Store volumes (ec2)
--> Network attached storage : Storage over the network, we can attach to servers..: EFS 										(ec2)

--> S3 is a Object based storage.
--> We store all data in Buckets. 
--> S3 is global platform.  (While creating We need to choose the region)
--> Softlimit : Bucket count : 100
--> Bucket Naming standards: (should comply with DNS standards)
	--> Bucketn name : Min 3 Char.. Max 63 char..
	--> bucket name should be unique across the golbe. 
	--> should not contains Capital letters.. 
	--> Name should start with .  , should not end with . , no adjesent ..
	--> Should not resemble IP address format (x 192.168.0.0)
--> No Pre-Provisioning required.
--> We have Unlimited storage in s3 patform.

--> S3 supports Max Object size : 5 TB
--> Min object size depends on Storage class.


If we want to share any data from S3 bucket, We need to modify "Block public access" settings on s3 bucket.

Object Path:
Standard Path syntax:   https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname

Virtual Paths: (if you want use this format, bucket name should not contain ".")
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.region.amazonaws.com/objectname


Storage Class: 

Aceess pattern : How frequently you are accessing data.. 

Frequently accesing data 	: S3-Standard
Infrequently accessing data 	: Standard-IA, OneZone-IA
Archieve 			: Glacier , Glacier Deep Archieve (restore to view)
Easily reprodusable data 
/ NonMission critical 		: RRS (Reduced Redundancy Storage)
unknown access patterns 	: Intelligent tier

SC		Availability		Durability		AZs	Min obj size

Standard : 	99.99%			99.999999999 %		3	0 bytes
Stanadrd IA	99.9%			""			3	128KB
Onezone-IA	99.9%			""			1	128KB
Glacier		99.99%			""			3	40KB
Glacie DA	99.99%			""			3	40KB
Intelligent 	99.9%			""			3	0 bytes
RRS		99.99%			99.99% (less dura)

Metadata : Data about the data.. AWS Gives metadata automatically. 
Combination of Key and Value pairs.. 


Versioning : 

--> Track all changes happening on our data.
--> It works as a backup option also.
--> Version ID generates automatically.
--> Uploaded time plays key role.

When Versioning : HIDE
--> If you delete an object, we will get a delete Marker.
--> Delete the Delete market to get the file back to s3 platform.

When Versioning : SHOW
--> If you delete an object, object delete perminently.


SRR : Same Region Replication : Source bucket and destination bucket resides in same region
CRR : Cross Region Replication : Source bucket in 1 region, Destination bucket in another region..

--> Versioning must be enabled on source & Destination bucket.
--> We can change the storage class for treplicated objects.


Task : COnfigure the Life cycle Rule to transit data from S3 Standard to Delete automatically after 7 days.

Task 2 : Configure the SRR between 2 buckets and replicate the data with s3standard only.

Task 3 : While configuring SRR, What is Priority.???

Task 4 : Can we configure replication from "One source bucket to multiple destination buckets..??

Server access logging: Log option on one individual bucket. We can store logs on same bucket or another bucket.

Static Website Hosting: 
Domain Name should be same as Bucket Name
Upload all data, We need to provide minimum of Read access on our data. 
--> You no need to worry abaout the server configuration / applciation configuration.
--> Website availability : 99.99% , Durability : 99.999999999 %

http://avinash.website.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

http://bucketname.s3-website.region.amazonaws.com	--> Map your domain (Route53)

Http status codes:
2XX --> OK/Success
3XX --> Redirection error
4XX --> Client Side error
5XX --> Server Side error

Object Lock : Designed to protect our data. Once enabled, noone can delete the data.
--> Must be enabled while creating bucket only. 
--> Versioning must be enabled.

Governance mode can be disabled by AWS accounts that have specific IAM permissions.
Compliance mode cannot be disabled by any user, including the root account.


Transfer acceleration : It allow us to use aws CDN service called Cloudfront. Edge locations used for upload / download.


S3 Events : 
--> SQS
--> Lambda
--> SNS : Simple Notification Service.. 

Requester pays : Instead of bucket owner, Who is requesting data, he will get charged.

Analysis : Storage class analysis :  Amazon S3 analyzes your access patterns and suggests a candidate age to transition objects to Standard - IA for a lifecycle rule.

inventory Report : You can receive a file of your object inventory on a daily or weekly basis for the entire bucket or a shared prefix.

KMS : Key Management Service : We can encrypt all the data.. 

Symmetric : A single encryption key that is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations.
Asymmetric : A public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations.


3 Types Encryptions: 

In-Transit :
	--> SSL /TLS

Server Side Encrytpion / At Rest : 
	--> SSE - S3 (AES-256) : WHoever have valid permissions he can view data.
	--> SSE - KMS : Key generates and manages in KMS. While creating key we need to 			provide key usage permissions to IAM users.
	--> SSE - C (Customer Provided Key) : KMS Manages the key, which is provided by 			customer.

Client Side Encrytion: If you don't want to send encryption keys to AWS / If you don;t want to send unencrypted data to AWS we can use CSE with our own encryption softwares.

Key Usage : Who can use the key.
Key Administrator : Who can administrate the key including Delete.

Customer managed keys :  "NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY."

ACL

Access for other AWS accounts : We can share this s3 bucket to another aws user.
--> We need another user's Cananical ID... 
--> Another user can access data using 3rd party applications / AWS CLI.

Bucket Policy : 
--> Writtens in JSON format.
--> 

PolicyGen: 

--> Resource : Bucket 		: arn:aws:s3:::avinash1
--> Principal : User 		: arn:aws:iam::518084852393:user/s3user
--> Effect : Allow / Deny	: Deny
--> Action : 

ARN : Amazon Resource Name : 


Bucket Level Operation : arn:aws:s3:::avinash1
Object level operation : arn:aws:s3:::avinash1/*


CORS : Cross Origin Resource Sharing : 

Managing S3 using 3rd party applications :
--> Cloudberry explorer : Freeware
--> S3Browser
--> Cyberduck
--> Winscp
